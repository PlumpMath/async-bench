# async-bench

This projects provides some micro benchmarks designed to benchmark certain aspects of the core.async IOC code.

NOTE: This code is designed to help developers to evaluate the performance impact of certain changes to the IOC code. The performance impact
of using IOC code in your project will most likely be much much lower than what is shown here. So take all performance metrics with a 
metric ton of salt.
